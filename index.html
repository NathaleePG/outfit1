        <p class="sub">A Modern Chic-Boho Look</p>
        <div id="pic1">

            <p>Just kidding! Summer isn’t over yet (thank goodness), August is but don’t worry because we still have
            until the 22nd of September when summer really IS over. But all else aside, this means that we must go out
            there and wear our favourite trends of the season a few more times before they get locked up in our
            beautiful closets until the next time around (wahhh ).<br/><br/>

            So today, I went downtown with a girlfriend and we both decided to go all out on what to wear. Being the
            super excited person I am, I pulled out my favourite pieces of the summer (while still trying to be weather
            appropriate) and rocked it!<br/><br/>

            If you follow me on instagram, you’d probably know that I’m a very feminine girl who loves to wear light
            colours (especially pink). I might be one of the ‘girliest’ girls you’d ever meet because I love anything
            that looks pretty, dainty and sweet. Though there are still times when I like to wear dark, edgy and
            casual clothing, light pastel colours make me feel the happiest and the most confident.</p>
            <p id="align1">It’s the last day of summer…</p>
        </div>
        <div id="pic2">
            <div id="img2"></div>
            <p>I’m so in love with the off the shoulder tops this year, it’s such an elegant trend. The one that
                I'm wearing in particular have these wide and flowy sleeves decorated with intricate pattern and
                flowers. The flower prints and frilled texture make this look quite boho and it's so airy and light
                making it appropriate to wear during the warm summer months. I love it. I also paired this shirt with
                my ripped, light denim jeans by Guess, adding to that fun boho look.<br/><br/>

                As much as I like the natural and vintage bohemian style, I love adding my favourite jewelled
                accessories such as these two bracelets from Banana Republic. I also wore my watch that were crafted
                with wooden beads by Avon and this one was given to me by Anmol (thanks boo! <3). Now my outfit has
                turned from casual to chic, with just a few blingy bracelets!</p>
            <p id="align2">Let’s get on with the outfit!!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="pic3">
            <div id="img3"></div>
            <p>Last but not least, I wore my black mules to match my printed shirt, turning this vintage bohemian look
                into a modern one. By the way, these mules were by Marc Fisher. Lastly, I finished this look with a
                beige bag by Michael Kors because honestly, it matches with everything! What I like about it most is
                that it’s medium sized, so I can still bring lots of essentials along with me without having to carry
                a large bag (#girlproblems). You know, gotta be prepared! Hehe <3<br/><br/>

                Anyways, I guess that’s it for now. Thanks for hanging out with me and checking out what outfit I put
                together this season!<br/><br/>
                .<br/>

                .<br/><br/>

                Until next time,<br/><br/>

                Stay confident, and be you. #roar<br/><br/><br/>
